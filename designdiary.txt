I really enjoyed this project! I think it was more encouraging to explore when we had starter code provided. 
I enjoy redesigning things, so I went to town on this one. I switched out the background png, enemies, bullet, spaceship. It gave
me more motivation to explore and implement new features. I decided to add a second enemy, which would be worth 2 points. 
I also added the final score to the game over screen, which was just a single line of code. One thing that was throwing me off
with the starter code was the ability to still continue to play once the Game Over screen appeared. I implemented new code to 
stop the game loop once the Game over screen is present. I enjoy knowing what I'm getting into when I decide to play a game, 
therefore I created a menu screen. This displays enemy points and allows the user to decide when to start playing. The enemies 
also begin to move faster once the player starts gaining more points. 
My stretch goals for this would be implementing a high score system.
